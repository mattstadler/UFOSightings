# UFOSightings

## Overview
- The purpose of this assignment is to create a webpage via javascript / html to allow users to search UFO sighting data based on various criteria.

## Results
- The webpage can be used by entering data into one or more of the search criteria boxes. The page will then update to display only the UFO sightings that meet the inputted criteria.

## Summary
- One potential drawback of this new design is that it may be confusing to users. Specifically, it may not be intuitive whether users can filter based on just one criteria or if they have to enter data in each filter box. Two recommendations include: 1) updating the styling to include filter buttons under each filter box to show that you can filter based on one criteria, and 2) adding a 'clear' button that automatically removes all the filter data so it can be easily updated.
